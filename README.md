# food-delivery-market-analysis
A data analysis project based on Zomato’s restaurant dataset, including data cleaning, visualization, and insights extraction for understanding customer preferences, restaurant ratings, and market trends.

 **Project Overview**
In this project, we explore the Zomato dataset to answer key analytical questions such as:
1. Which restaurants have the highest ratings?
2. How does cost affect rating?
3. What cuisines are most popular?
4. How do online delivery and table booking options impact customer choices?
5. Which cities have the most restaurant density?

This analysis helps uncover meaningful insights that can support business decisions for food delivery companies and restaurants.
